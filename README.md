# Machine Learning Project

This Jupyter Notebook repository contains various machine learning projects, including:

- Customer Churn Prediction
- Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Spam SMS Detection
- Movie Genre Classification

Each project involves building, training, and evaluating machine learning models to solve specific problems.


Project Details:

1. Customer Churn Prediction
Predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage patterns and demographic information.

Model: Logistic Regression, Random Forests,  Gradient Boosting
Performance: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

2.Credit Card Fraud Detection
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection
Model: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree
Performance: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

3.Spam SMS Detection
Classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
